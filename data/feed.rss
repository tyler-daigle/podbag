      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/brohiopodcast/cuccio-full-episode</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Cheryl Pierson-Cuccio grew up in Long Island, New York.  At a very young age, she was forced to keep a very dark secret.  Eventually the burden of being a victim her entire life became too much.  Cheryl and her future husband, Rob Cuccio, hashed a plan to kill her father for the atrocities he'd committed against her for her entire life.  Cheryl has since written a book, Incest, Murder and a Miracle: The True Story Behind the Cheryl Pierson Murder-For-Hire Headlines and the power of love, to share her struggles and tell her own story.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[This is undoubtedly one of the deepest dives we've ever gone on. We speak with Bob, owner of the youtube channel "Tales From The Dark". Bob is what we'll call a "darkness investigator". Bob is currently in an investigation that is linking a world wide dream survey with the Futel "payphone project". There are so many clues connecting this wild ride, including the possibility that these "Payphones" are possibly part. Of the I-75 sex trade corridor. There is also a link between these dream Surveys and an apocalypse scenario scheduled for Sept 5th of 2020. This is a profound investigation that will leave you dumbfounded. <br /><br />Bobs Channel "Tales From The Dark"<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpnzhRSRUdl9Dx2I1da8GwQ" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpnzhRSRUdl9Dx2I1da8GwQ</a>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Britney Spears is a generational icon unlike anything we've ever seen.  Every 30-something year old in the world has a soft spot for the "Princess of Pop".  Recently, there has been a movement, the #freebritney movement, which aims to break the chains of the conservatorship that has held her hostage for the past decade.  Her Father, Jaime Spears, controls every aspect of Britney's life.  She can't vote, drive and doesn't even have access to her own money.  Britney can't even leave the house legally without his permission.  Also, we explore the possibility of Britney being a slave, or "monarch" in the Project MKUltra program.<br /><br />***SPONSORS**<br /><br />Time to start betting money on sports and WINNING MONEY.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[ <br />It's time to get spoopy!!  This could easily be one of the most haunted houses in America.  Late one night near the turn of the century (1900), a little girl named Sallie was rushed to the front door of the town doctor, Charles Finney.  She was immediately diagnosed with appendicitis and Doctor Finney started surgery that instant! Little Sallie died on the table with little to zero anesthesia.  The moment she passed, she believed she was being tortured by the doctor. The home still stands and one couple claims the home is haunted by vicious demons. They have the testimony to back it up!!  Join us on this paranormal adventure.<br /> <br />Support us:  patreon.com/brohiopodcast]]>

      <googleplay:description>One of the most storied families in the history of the USA are the Kennedys.  You may be familiar with the death of JFK, but there are many other deaths and misfortunes associated with this family that lead to the belief that they're cursed.  The patriarch, Joseph Kennedy Sr, was a sex addict that was deeply rooted in the organized crime mafias in Chicago during the early 1900's. His thirst for political greatness guided his decisions he made about his family. This includes: hiding from the public a daughter that he sought a lobotomy for.  She was exiled from the family, never to be seen or heard from after the damage from the surgery was done.
